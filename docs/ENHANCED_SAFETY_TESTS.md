# Install Miri (if not already installed)
rustup +nightly component add miri

# Run all enhanced memory safety tests with Miri
cargo +nightly miri test enhanced_memory_safety

# Run specific test with Miri
cargo +nightly miri test enhanced_memory_safety::test_use_after_free_protection
```

#### Using the Test Runner Script
```bash
# Run comprehensive Miri testing
./run_miri_tests.sh
```

The script provides:
