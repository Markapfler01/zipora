| 10MB | 1.6 ms | 1.3 ms | **0.81x** (Standard I/O 1.2x faster) | üü¶ Standard |

**Analysis**: Standard file I/O outperforms memory mapping for these workload patterns, likely due to:
- Overhead of memory mapping setup for smaller files
- Better kernel optimizations for sequential file access
- Cache efficiency in standard I/O operations
