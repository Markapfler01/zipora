| Lookup 10K items | 51.9 µs | 59.2 µs | **1.1x faster** | 🦀 Rust |

**Analysis**: Rust's GoldHashMap (using AHash) provides consistent advantages in insertion operations while maintaining competitive lookup performance.

### 5. Memory Mapping Performance

File I/O and memory mapping comparison shows interesting patterns.

| File Size | Memory Mapped | Standard I/O | Performance Ratio | Winner |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|

| 10MB | 1.6 ms | 1.3 ms | **0.81x** (Standard I/O 1.2x faster) | 🟦 Standard |

**Analysis**: Standard file I/O outperforms memory mapping for these workload patterns, likely due to:
- Overhead of memory mapping setup for smaller files
- Better kernel optimizations for sequential file access
- Cache efficiency in standard I/O operations
